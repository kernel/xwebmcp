Tools for Delta Air Lines (https://www.delta.com).

| tool | file | status | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| search_flights | [search_flights.js](search_flights.js) | qa_passed | Independent targeted QA passed; successful full live invocation remains blocked by intermittent HTTP 429 responses. |

## Scope

- Namespace: `delta.com`. Match patterns: `https://delta.com/*` and `https://*.delta.com/*`.
- CDP-backed, read-only flight shopping for one-way and round-trip cash fares, 1–9 adults, within a 330-day booking window. No fare selection, purchases, payments, or personal-data entry.
- On invocation, check for an idle, usable booking form at the exact entry URL. Otherwise navigate to `https://www.delta.com/flightsearch/book-a-flight` before interacting. An unrelated page, a baggage page, results, query-bearing booking state, or an open form overlay does not satisfy this check.
- Return structured first-page outbound options: marketing airline and flight numbers, airports, local times, displayed overnight-arrival date, duration, stops, and lowest available displayed fare per row. Round trips do not return selected outbound/return pairs. Prices are rounded display fares, not passenger totals or guaranteed quotes; the currency symbol is preserved without guessing its ISO code.
- `result_count` counts returned rows, not every matching flight. Failures return `status: "error"`, `flights: []`, and `result_count: null`. An explicit empty state is distinguished from a site error. Input-schema rejections may occur before execution and therefore have no tool output.

## Loading

The tool file is a single self-contained expression evaluating to an array. It has no registration side effects or imports. Read its contents as `source`, then register in the Browser REPL:

```js
await webmcp.addCustomTools({
  namespace: "delta.com",
  forceOverwriteNamespace: true,
  tools: eval(source),
});
const live = (await webmcp.listTools()).find(
  (t) => t.source.custom?.namespace === "delta.com" &&
    t.tool.name === "search_flights",
);
const result = await webmcp.invokeTool(live.tool_ref, {
  origin: "JFK",
  destination: "LHR",
  depart_date: "2026-11-10",
  return_date: "2026-11-18",
  trip_type: "round_trip",
  passengers: 2,
}, { timeoutSec: 120 });
repl.write(JSON.stringify(result));
```

Use future dates within the booking window and obtain a fresh tool reference after navigation. Only evaluate trusted source. Replacing the namespace replaces all its custom tools.

## Site quirks

- Airport codes must be selected from the airport picker; typing a code alone does not select an airport. Dates use a month calendar, and trip type/passenger count use comboboxes.
- Results render client-side at `/flightsearch/search-results?cacheKeySuffix=...`. The corresponding search context stores a round trip in one segment with both `departureDate` and `returnDate`.
- Desktop flight paths differ from mobile test-ID markup. Partner-marketed flight links use an analytics attribute, and an empty badge-only header can precede the actual duration. Hidden rows and fare cells must be excluded.
- Wait for skeleton removal and populated fares, then 1,500 ms of unchanged result DOM. This is a resettable DOM-quiescence check, not proof of completion if another row arrives after a longer silent interval. The execution uses a 105-second wait budget within a 120-second invocation timeout.
- Delta intermittently responds with HTTP 429 and redirects to the booking page with `SFAF001_429` or `SFAF001`. Do not interpret that as zero available flights or retry repeatedly. The current parser targets the English desktop layout. Real zero-results behavior remains unverified.

## QA summary

Independent QA agent: `agt_b189571b6d300a05921c`, three passes on 2026-09-24. No actionable defect reproduced in the final targeted regression cases. This is **qa_passed**, not **verified**: there is still no successful final full-tool live invocation.

| Check | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Short-haul CVG–ATL round trip / one way, one passenger | Live attempts reached a readiness timeout or provider error; successful output blocked. |
| Long-haul JFK–LHR round trip, two passengers | Parser separately extracted 20 real rendered first-page rows, including connections, overnight dates, and prices. Full final invocations received provider 429 errors. The DOM parse is not an end-to-end invocation success. |
| Far-future LAX–JFK one way, three passengers | Calendar/form flow reached a provider 429; successful output blocked. |
| Zero-results candidate ATL–IPC | Picker accepted IPC; provider error prevented checking real empty-result behavior. |
| Eleven invalid-input cases | All rejected; none reported zero results. |
| Synthetic parser/schema regression | Passed explicit schema checks; excluded hidden rows/fares, handled duplicate empty duration, desktop fields, partner numbers, connections, overnight dates, and rejected mismatched date/passenger context. Synthetic prices are not live fares. |
| Synthetic incremental rendering | Second row at 50 ms and its fare at 300 ms: readiness returned both populated rows after 1,805 ms. |
| Synthetic empty state / unfinished fare | Empty state passed after skeleton removal; unfinished fare reached the shortened test timeout. |

### Domain-convention migration check

On 2026-09-24, re-registered under `delta.com`, removed the old `airline_tools.search_flights` registration, and invoked from `https://www.delta.com/us/en/baggage/overview` rather than the homepage or booking form. The tool navigated to booking, submitted JFK–LHR for 2026-11-10 through 2026-11-18 with two adults, and reached a results URL. After 21.735 seconds, it returned the unchanged explicit error shape with `SITE_ERROR: ... #SFAF001_429`, no flights, and a null count. This verifies entry navigation and failure behavior, not successful flight retrieval.

Local checks also evaluate the file as one array expression, compare both schemas with the previously QA-tested source, and exercise navigation from unsuitable pages versus reuse of a clean booking form.
